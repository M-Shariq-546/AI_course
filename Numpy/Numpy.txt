If We use np.int8 so we have to be careful because in this case out integerr would be largeer than 3 digits

And if you think that your number is larger value than you can also use int32 or int128 etc

linspace is used for making array of equal size and space

np.empty is used for making and empty array but having any random values .

np.identity(size) is used for making identity array of given size .


#Important Functions of Numpy

arr.ravel() convert the array into single row array of total size.

In axis ,, Axis = 0 represents rows , and Axis =1 represent columns.

ar.sum(axis =0)
ar.sum(axis =1) BOth these functions are used to calculate the sums of rows and columns of the array.

ar.flat
for item in ar.flat:
    print(item)

This Piece of code helps in making array flat and represent in row major order . Means First row elements 2nd row and so on.

ar.argmax() gives the maximum number's index
